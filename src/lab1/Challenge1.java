/**
 * The purpose of this challenge is to give you practice time using
 * Java Exception handling techniques.
 * <p>
 * Your challenge is to consider all the possible things that can go wrong
 * with this program and use exception handling where appropriate to prevent
 * the program from crashing. In addition you must display a friendly error
 * message in a JOptionPane and ask the user to try again. (Yes, this violates 
 * the Single Responsibility Principle, but for this lab, we'll overlook that.)
